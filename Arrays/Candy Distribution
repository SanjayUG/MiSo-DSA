Problem statement
You are given an integer ‘N’ and an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ containing positive integers.

You have ‘N’ friends, and you want to give each of them some candies. The ‘ith’ friend will be happy if they receive at least ‘A[i]’ candies. You want to distribute candies among your friends to fulfill the following two conditions.

No two friends have the same number of candies.

Every friend is happy.

Your task is to find the minimum candies required for distributing such that both conditions are met. If no distribution fulfills both given conditions, report it.

Example :
‘N’ = 5, ‘A’ = [3, 3, 2, 5, 1]
If we distribute candies in the following manner [4, 3, 2, 5, 1],
Each friend will be happy as they have at least received ‘A[i]’ candies, and no two friends got the same number of candies.
Hence, the answer is (4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 1) = 15. It’s guaranteed that this is the minimum number of candies required.
